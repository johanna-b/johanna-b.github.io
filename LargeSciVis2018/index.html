<h2>Course Description</h2>
    Recent advances in image and volume acquisition as well as computational advances in simulation have led to an explosion of the amount of data that must be visualized and analyzed. Modern visualization techniques combine the parallel processing power of GPUs with out-of-core methods and data streaming to enable the interactive exploration of giga- and terabytes of image and volume data. A major enabler for interactivity is making both the computational and the visualization effort proportional to the amount of data that is actually visible on screen, decoupling it from the full data size. This leads to powerful display-aware multi-resolution techniques that enable the visualization of data of almost arbitrary size.


<h4>Level</h4>
Introductory

<h4>Intended Audience</h4>
    We target researchers and practitioners in visualization and computer graphics that want to learn recent GPU techniques and hardware/API capabilities for implementing visualization systems that scale to very large data. The course will also be interesting for people interested in processing and rendering gigapixel images in a scalable manner.

<h4>Course Prerequisites</h4>
    Course participants should have a basic understanding of how GPUs work and how they are programmed using standard graphics APIs such as OpenGL or Direct3D, and a basic
    understanding of general-purpose GPU programming using CUDA or OpenCL.

    <p class="talk_title">Introduction, Basics of Scalable Visualization and GPU Virtual Memory Architectures [60 min]
    </p>

    After introducing the course, I will describe GPU-based visualization techniques, focusing on GPU ray-casting for large volume data. We will look at fundamental data structures such as grids and trees, and discuss how to perform traversal on GPUs. We will discuss the basics of rendering large images and volumes using out-of-core approaches, and I will describe the basic ray-casting optimization techniques of empty space skipping and early ray termination with a focus on large data. I will give an overview of virtual texturing on GPUs and how virtual memory hierarchies can be employed for the interactive visualization of data of almost arbitrary size.

    <img class="talk_teaser" src="images/scalablevis.jpg" width="300" alt="Scalable Volume Visualization Architectures and Applications" />

    I will start by explaining some advanced techniques for large-scale ray-casting, including multi-level page tables for accessing terabyte-sized volumes on the GPU. In the second part of my talk, I will introduce and compare different volume processing architectures for handling large data. Data streaming and on-demand construction of 3D data blocks allows to circumvent expensive pre-processing and allows to process and stream data entirely on-demand, thereby limiting the amount of data that has to be handled to the visible subset on the screen. In the last part of my talk I will present higher-level applications that are built on top of current GPU-based visualization systems for large-scale data. I will present a system for query-guided visual analysis of large volumetric electron microscopy data, built on top of a powerful petascale visualization system.

    <img class="talk_teaser" src="images/spdf.png" width="300" alt="Scalable Volume Visualization Architectures and Applications" />

    <br>
    I will give an overview of display-aware techniques for the visualization and processing of gigapixel images and large-scale volume data, where the computational effort is proportional to the actually visible data instead of to the original data size. I will describe multi-resolution data structures that encode the information of high-resolution data in multi-resolution pyramids, e.g., using probability density functions of local pixel or voxel neighborhoods. This enables the accurate visualization of high-resolution data with arbitrary transfer functions at any output resolution.

        <img class="talk_teaser" src="images/emptyspace.png" width="300" alt="Scalable Volume Visualization Architectures and Applications" />

        I will give an overview of current GPU-based ray-guided volume rendering algorithms, which have been demonstrated to be the most efficient approaches for interactive volume rendering of large data. Furthermore, I will describe recent extension to these ray-guided strategies, to enable efficient empty space skipping of large datasets containing fine and intricate structures. We will cover recent methods that limit the fragmentation of space that often occurs when skipping empty regions, and present a method that supports dynamic and interactive updates of 'empty' regions. By moving the major cost of empty space skipping out of the ray-casting stage and into the faster hardware rasterization stage, empty space skipping becomes scalable than standard octree empty space skipping approaches. Finally, I will also talk about efficient deterministic and probabilistic data structures that can be used for culling and empty space skipping of large-scale segmentation volumes, and describe a hybrid deterministic and probabilistic scalable culling architecture.
